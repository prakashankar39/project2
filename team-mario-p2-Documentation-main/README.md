# TeamUp

TeamUp is a full-stack java application developed by founders Mario Portilla, Prakash Shankar, Kyle Polner, Josue Rodriguez, and Vivian Trevino. The overall purpose of TeamUp is to help people find sporting events locally that they would not be able to find otherwise. This solves a huge issue problem that many people face in their respective communities.

## Description

How many times have you wanted to be outside and active but have no one or no where to do it? How about just wanting to play your favorite sport but again you dont have any friends your age that you can call for a pick up game? Here at TeamUp, we all had similar experiences and found data that suggests in todays technology driven world, people are becoming less and less active. So, we decided to do something about it and together we developed TeamUp, a revolutionary application that will change how you sport forever. TeamUp allows people who are looking for pick up games to connect with eachother effortlessly by skill level, location, and sport. You are able to create new events, attend events of any sport you can find, as well as cancel or change venues at will. We want to be the reason people look forward to going outside again!
Please enjoy our application, and we hope that you have a ton of fun, stay healthy and make many friends in your TeamUp adventures.
